# Flex Sensor

A flex sensor, also known as a bend sensor, is a type of sensor designed to measure deflection or bending. Typically constructed using materials such as plastic and carbon, the sensor consists of a plastic strip with a carbon surface arranged on it. When the strip is bent, the resistance of the sensor changes accordingly. This change in resistance is directly proportional to the amount of bending or deflection the sensor experiences. Essentially, the more the sensor bends in one direction, the higher its resistance becomes. This characteristic makes flex sensors valuable for applications where detecting and measuring bending or flexing is essential.

## Pin Configuration

The flex sensor features a two-terminal pin configuration, labelled as P1 and P2. Unlike components like diodes or capacitors, it lacks polarized terminals, meaning there's no distinction between positive and negative terminals. It requires a DC voltage ranging from 3.3V to 5V to activate the sensor.
