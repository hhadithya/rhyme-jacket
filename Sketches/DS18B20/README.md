![ds18b20 picture](https://techshop.lk/cdn/shop/products/DS18B20.jpg?v=1676439313)

## Features

- Unique 1-Wire interface requires only one port pin for communication
- Power supply range is 3.0V to 5.5V
- Measures temperatures from -55°C to +125°C. Fahrenheit equivalent is -67°F to +257°F
- ±0.5°C accuracy from -10°C to +85°C

## Challenges

- Environment temperature can be differed according to the place. And those differed temperature can affect the body temperature , resulting in false assumptions of getting tired.
