# Fatigue level detection by using DS18B20

![ds18b20 picture](https://techshop.lk/cdn/shop/products/DS18B20.jpg?v=1676439313)

## Features

- Unique 1-Wire interface requires only one port pin for communication
- Power supply range is 3.0V to 5.5V
- Measures temperatures from -55°C to +125°C. Fahrenheit equivalent is -67°F to +257°F
- ±0.5°C accuracy from -10°C to +85°C

## Wires

## Challenges

Environment temperature can be differed according to the place. And those differed temperature can affect the body temperature , resulting in false assumptions of getting tired.

## Coding

- There are **three fatigue levels** like Level 0, Level 1, Level 2. Level 2 means too tired and level 0 means not tired. A blinking <font color="Red">Red</font> LED is used to indicate level 2 fatigueness. A blinking <font color='Blue'>blue</font> LED is used to indicate level 1 fatigueness. The <font color='Green'>Green</font> light is the indicator for level 0 fatigueness. The child can resume the game when that blub blinks.
- The code is supported for cold and hot temperatures as well.
