## Overview

<p>Rechargeable lithium polymer (LiPo) batteries are widely utilized in a wide range of electronic devices, including smartphones, drones, and remote-controlled cars.</p>

## How to Connect

- Identify the positive (red) and negative (black) terminals of both the LiPo battery and the charging module.
- Connect the positive terminal of the battery to the positive terminal of the charging module.
- Connect the negative terminal of the battery to the negative terminal of the charging module.
- Ensure that the connections are secure and there are no loose wires.
- If your charging module has a balance connector, plug it in as well.

## Safety measures

- LiPo batteries should always be handled carefully to avoid harm or damage.
- LiPo batteries should not be crushed, punctured, or left in direct sunlight.
- LiPo batteries should not be overcharged or over-discharged since this might result in decreased performance, swelling, or even fire dangers.
