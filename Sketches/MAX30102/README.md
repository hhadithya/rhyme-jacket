## MAX30102 Pulse oximeter and Heart rate sensor:-

The aim of using the MAX30102 sensor is to check the heart rate.
 The purpose of checking heart rate is to monitor tiredness.
The sensor is placed on the pointing finger  of the glow.

## Why MAX30102:

Implement algorithms to filter noise and extract accurate heart rate data.
Minimize factors like light, temperature, and motion to maintain accuracy.
Combines LEDs, photodetector, and signal processing, simplifying hardware design
