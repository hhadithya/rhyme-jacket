## Problem in Brief
Childhood obesity and sedentary behaviours are rising due to increased screen time and digital engagement. This affects children's health, education, and personal growth. Our project proposes an innovative solution that combines technology, exercise, and music to give children a fun and engaging experience that can improve their health and enjoyment.

## Proposed Solution
The Interactive Music and Exercise Jacket is designed for children who don't exercise enough. It has advanced hardware, like flex sensors, gyroscopes, and a heart rate monitor, all coordinated by an ESP32 board for a responsive experience. It identifies exercises, tracks heart rate, and connects physical activity to music production for an entertaining experience.
